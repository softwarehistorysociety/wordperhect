# Word Perhect

## Tomoko Takahashi's digital art "parody" of Word Processors from 1999-2000.

While there is still a [**working instance of Word Perhect on The Web**](https://wordperhect.e-2.org/) as of November, 2020, it is not immediately accessible without re-enabling Flash support on a modern web browser. I created this archive out of a desire to preserve this beautiful thing in case its presence elsewhere becomes challenged in the near future.

*From the [Chisenhale Gallery's exhibition page](https://chisenhale.org.uk/exhibition/tomoko-takahashi/):*

> *Word Perhect* is a specially commissioned web project that parodies the word processor. Working with a specialist programmer, Tomoko Takahashi produces a new and fully functioning online version of the well-known software.
>
> *Word Perhect* presents an idiosyncratic, hand drawn interface with functioning but personally ‘sketched’ tools. Takahashi’s rendering of the word processor takes not only a contemporary approach to drawing but crucially undermines the imposition of standardised, corporate language onto our own writing.
>
> *Word Perhect* is Tomoko Takahashi’s first project for the web and is also a ground-breaking collaboration between Chisenhale Gallery and digital arts organisation e-2.
>
> Tomoko Takahashi was born in Tokyo, and studied at the Tama Art University, Goldsmiths College and the Slade School of Fine Art between 1985 and 1998. Takahashi and *Word Perhect* are nominated for the Turner Prize 2000 at Tate Britain. Takahashi lives and works in London.

*From [the post on my experimental WordPress site](https://www.davidblue.wtf/word-perhect-tomoko-takahashi/) about archiving Word Perhect:*

I'm currently reading Professor Matthew G. Kirschenbaum's *[Track Changes: A Literary History of Word Processing](http://bit.ly/trackchangesharvard)*, which mentions a whole host of things I would love to share (some I will on this site, I'm sure, in the coming months.) One of them which I could not find any video of on the internet: a project from either 1999 or 2000[efn_note]*Track Changes* says 1999, [Google](https://g.co/kgs/Aes1Wg) says 2000.[/efn_note], by Japanese artist [Tomoko Takahashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoko_Takahashi) called *Word Perhect*. Before I go on, here's the whole passage (from Pg. 205-206:)

> A similar impulse is at work in Tomoko Takahashi’s *WordPerhect* [*sic*] (1999) an online piece (rendered in Flash) that presents the user with a roughly drawn cartoon word processing interface, limned in what appears to be black ink on a white background.88 Typing generates crude, seemingly handwritten, less-than-perfect characters on the screen. Takahashi’s word processor is fully functional, but the interface yields an inversion of the typical user-friendly experience. Clicking on the Mail icon produces the following set of instructions, which appear as a scrap of notepaper “taped” to the screen: “print the document, put into an envelope or something similar [*sic*] which can contain the document. Go to post office and weigh it and buy stamps”—and so on, for another hundred words, including further typos and blemishes.

When I went looking for the project, I actually found a re-upload of the Flash application(!) though, of course, I had to cycle through my personal collection of web browsers before I found one which would allow Flash again. (The same option that was supposed to allow it in Chrome did not work in any Chromium-based browsers except for Edge Chromium, which I used.) Other than a [commisions page from e-2.org](https://e-2.org/commissions/wordperhect.html) for the re-upload, I found very little about the project. Here's the description from that page, for the sake of thoroughness:

> As word processing software becomes ever more advanced, correcting syntax and spelling errors, these familiar programmes begin to impose a standardised corporate language onto our writing. 
> Takahashi has produced her own fully functioning online version which undermines this dehumanising process. Reclaiming the initiative back from the software, Word Perhect presents an idiosyncratic hand-drawn interface leading to a set of functioning but strangely altered tools.
> [*Word Perhect* - e-2.org Commissions Page](https://e-2.org/commissions/wordperhect.html)

When I discover this sort of thing, I always seem to feel this sense of anxiety regarding how much longer they'll be accessible. Before I tried Edge Chromium, I booted up my Windows Whistler Virtual Machine's Internet Explorer, which will still render Google.com, but returned an error on the *Word Perhect* re-upload. Again... anxious. *I've got to document this **right this moment**!* I know it's mostly irrational, but - in the middle of class - I whipped out OBS as soon as I got it working and recorded my first-time experiences and published the video to [YouTube](https://youtu.be/KXIJa5Ge_bY) and [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/470409059).
